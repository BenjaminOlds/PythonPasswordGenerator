# PythonPasswordGenerator

## What is this?

This is a secure password generator developed in Python 3.7. Feel free to steal the code and do whatever you want with it, or play around with it, or use it as a reference on how password generators work if you're new to programming, I plan to add features in the future, like writing and reading from file to help generate. 

## Enjoy =)
